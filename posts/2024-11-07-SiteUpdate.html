<p>hello and welcome to the new and improved princess pengy dot neocities dot com! after discovering some new website tools and smashing some stuff together in javascript (with the help of my wonderful girlfriend) there's a lot of great stuff on display, and I've taken the opportunity to add a couple of new things too! here's what we've got:</p>
<ul>
	<li>comments powered by <a href="https://cusdis.com/">cusdis!</a> they require manual moderation, but my website traffic is low enough that that's not really an issue at all, and I'll do my best to be prompt about it. this is the one thing that was really important to me to have on my website, because I always love a good discussion, so hopefully it'll pan out!! if you liked a post and wanna talk about it, please leave a comment!!</li>
	<br>
	<li>a tagging system, new lil post navigation arrows that actually tell you what the adjacent posts are, and a bunch of code refactoring as adapted from <a href="https://codeberg.org/cdvr/Zonelots/src/branch/main">zonelots!</a> right now the tagging system is pretty loose and vibes based, so do let me know how you like it and if you have any ideas to make it better as I keep posting more stuff!</li>
	<br>
	<li>a friends page! you can visit it by clicking "friends" in the header! it's a page full of my friends who make stuff on the internet and that you should marvel at with me.</li>
	<br>
	<li>a recommendations page! you can visit it by clicking "recs" in the header! right now it doesn't have anything in it. but eventually it will, once I figure out how I want to format it!</li>
</ul>
<p>more strange gaming diaries catchup is on the wayâ€”there are still somehow a few games from 2023 and early 2024 that I haven't written about yet, but my goal is to bust through them all before the end of the year so we can start the new year with new games!</p>
<p>also, one last thing: I have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/princesspengy">patreon?</a> I set this up a pretty long while ago but I have a patreon and you can use it to give me money. as things stand the patreon is functionally just a tip jar you can commit to if you want to help me get by in this capitalist hellworld, but as I find new stuff to work on that isn't stream-of-consciousness blog posts I might post some behind the scenes stuff over there for you to see. or I might not! I make no promises about anything because I don't want to set up any inaccurate expectations. but it <i>would</i> mean a lot to me if I could have a little more help these days as a chronically unemployed extremely mentally ill trans woman. consider it, maybe!!</p>
