	<p>this was a tiny little thing I found in an itch bundle a few years back and decided to open up on a whim! there isn't a whole lot of game to talk about, but I insist on giving even the smallest of games equal billing with everything else for strange gaming diaries, so let's give it a whirl!</p>

	<p>though, for anyone interested in playing the game before reading the rest of the blog post, please be warned, the game has some of the most sensory overload inducing moments I've seen in both audio and visual spheres. take care of yourself!</p>
	
	<p>the first thing that struck out to me is that despite being a game with the word "contemplated" in the title and featuring very quiet and moody environments, there's a dreadfully uncomfortable feeling of overwhelmed anxiety to the whole experience. the floating orb-like figure—the eponymous sun of limbo, if I were to assume—rotates around the two-sided island at an unnatural speed, not giving you very much time to contemplate it at all before it dips under the horizon. and of course, there's what amounts to the game's ending, a truly horrible screeching storm of glitched polygons that silently drops the game's title before closing, as though the program itself has been overwhelmed past the point of function.</p>
	
	<p>there's a hostility to the game's world, but not one that feels focused or directed—the other figures encountered only start coming undone when you make contact with them, a volatile reaction caused by some sort of metaphysical instability. yet the player persists even when completely swallowed up by these unraveled shapes, creating a feeling of passively wreaking destruction where they tread. a silhouetted figure dissolves into glitchy madness when I pass, then when we next perform a full rotation, there's a grave marker where they once sat. did I do this?</p>
	
	<p>there's also the dual world itself, which of course could represent any number of things, but that I struggle to cleanly label in a way that lines up with what happens in the game. it could represent an outer/inner world sort of dynamic, but then why do you encounter figures that fall apart at your touch in both? once you encounter the first silhouette and sit at the chair on the other side of the world, what seems to be the same silhouette stands in front of you projecting an air of menace before vanishing. is the ending of the game a punishment?</p>
	
	<p>I did resonate with the fact that the first time you encounter this horrible glitching effect, it's very much by accident. when analyzing this game's themes, I inevitably find myself projecting a bit of my own fears onto it—I make all kinds of blunders and have a long history of worrying that they might have a disproportionately severe effect on people around me. when viewed from that angle, the game almost feels like a simulation of the fear of rejection, one single mistake weighing on you so heavily that your existence dissolves into a series of unpredictable reactions that terrify and overwhelm you.</p>
	
	<p>most of this is just me piecing things together in retrospect, though? the game didn't leave me too emotionally affected when I was playing it—there's a vagueness to it that prevents it from really digging its claws in. it's an interactive inkblot test, an experience that stimulates the senses in a way that demands consideration despite its thematic ephemerality. there's still value to that, but it's not the kind of thing you can really discuss in isolation and end up with anything grounded. I've been talking about it for the past six hundred and eleven words, sure, but I could probably do that about anything if I really wanted! that doesn't make this game special!</p>
