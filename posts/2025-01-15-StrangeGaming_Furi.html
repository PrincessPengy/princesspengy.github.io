	<p>this one's an odd little duck. developed by a studio founded by two former ubisoft employees, furi is a modern iteration of games like punch-out!! or no more heroes, being a flashy boss rush revolving around mechanical challenge and things like memorizing attack patterns and perfecting your movement techniques.</p>

	<p>and wow, is this game flashy! the soundtrack is nearly all bangers, the general environment design is sick, and the bosses of course have all sorts of love put into them. the writing, while nothing exceptional, was also just interesting enough to keep my attention between fights, and used an effective formula for maintaining tension and mystery. the player character is a prisoner, and during our escape we learn more about the context of that imprisonment by the people who are trying to stop us. there's a kinda silly faux-moral-choice element at the very end that feels arbitrarily tacked on, but it's not a dealbreaker.</p>
	
	<p>as for the combat that you'll be spending most of your time doing, it's an intriguing mixture of devil may cry style melee combat and twin-stick shooting! you generally alternate between these styles of gameplay with each of the boss's health bars you knock out, and the system by which you heal back to full at the end of each phase but have to restart the phase if you get one of your own health bars knocked out makes for an interesting push-and-pull that does a lot to promote the kind of rhythmic mindset the game wants to encourage in its players.</p>
	
	<p>then I got to fourth boss of the game, called the scale, and that was about where my feelings towards the game started to become very polarized. on the one hand, I utterly <i>adore</i> the scale stylistically—the music oozes menace, the voice actor is putting on a dramatically lurching and raspy performance, and the character looks like something out of one of the more fucked up parts of a metal gear solid game in all the best ways.</p>
	
	<p>but also, I got filtered <i>hard</i> by this guy's final phase. for those of you reading who haven't played the game before, lemme share a screenshot of the final bullet pattern this guy puts up:</p>
	<img src="/images/furi2.png">
	<p>these grid squares fucked with me really hard, because the length of your dash is just long enough to accidentally bonk you against the next line over quite a lot! and with the amount of bullet hell that you have to face in the meantime, trying to measure out how far each dash would take me was difficult for me to wrap my head around. not to mention, dying at this part of the fight would mean needing to do all of the previous (much easier) phases all over again.</p>
	
	<p>and I think this game made me realize that I just don't really vibe with that kind of punishing difficulty in my games! it threw off the rhythm at which I had been enjoying the game, and the fact that I had to go through so much before I could get to the part that I actually needed to study and practice on made things start to feel sloggy in a way that had a compounding effect on my ability to push through the difficulty spike.</p>
	
	<p>I had a similar moment playing through the first dark souls game, actually. when I first picked it up a while back, I was having a pretty good time with it—cleared through the first few bosses without issue, beat quelaag with a little bit more issue—but it was in my run through the final part of senn's fortress that I hit my wall. it was during that last part where you're getting shot at by all the cannons, and I was desperately running around trying to find the pre-boss bonfire. then I rounded the corner, a single skeleton guy caught me off guard, the rest of my hp was wiped, and I respawned at the very start of the dungeon with all my progress gone. it was at that point that I realized I wasn't having fun anymore, I put the game down, and I haven't played it again since.</p>
	
	<p>luckily, furi allows for a compromise: there's an easier difficulty mode called promenade that you can activate after dying to a boss. but...you can't turn it off afterwards. you're locked into the easier difficulty mode for the rest of the game. I was able to beat the game, sure, but the challenge that had kept me so enraptured across the first few fights was gone, and the experience started to feel a bit hollow as a result.</p>
	
	<p>I'm glad that these days we're mostly on the other side of hyper-difficult games being what the mainstream gaming public is obsessed with—or at least I <i>hope</i> we are—because the kind of puritanism surrounding the topic of difficulty in video games is frankly exhausting. furi is a game I almost respect for knowing exactly what it is in that regard, but in its arbitrary restrictions it frames dropping to an easier difficulty setting as a failure, a blemish on your playthrough that you have to drag along with you the entire time. this is a game built on the paradigm of difficulty-as-moral-merit, and that's just not a paradigm I'm interested in engaging with, which is a damn shame with how much else the game has going for it. hopefully, if I ever get around to playing through the rest of the studio's work, I'll get to see what their games can be without them burdening themselves with an idealistic perspective on certain design principles of decades ago.</p>
