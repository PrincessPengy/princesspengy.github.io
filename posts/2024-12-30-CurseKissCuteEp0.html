	<p>if you're a mid-2010s tumblr alum like me, you might be familiar with the work of valerie halla! he's an erotic artist known for both prose work like animal girlfriends, the webcomic goodbye to halos, and assorted porn under the "drool cutie" label that is frankly some of the hottest shit I've ever seen in my life. she's an artist uniquely in touch with ideas of sexuality and eroticism, and even though this preliminary episode of his latest story doesn't have any sex in it or even anything more explicit than some lovely bulge shots and a general narrative focus on a really big pair of boobs, it nonetheless speaks to those themes in ways that are both candid and deeply contemplative. her body of work is genuinely one of the foundations for the way I think about sex and love and identity, and was in no small part responsible for me figuring out the whole transgender thing back in the day. it's really good. valerie's work is so good and I need to talk to you about it.</p>

	<p>before digging into the meat of the narrative, the presentation of this story is something I want to discuss a bit. CURSE/KISS/CUTE is basically just a novel with a little bit more bits attached, but those bits offer more weight to the narrative than their simple scale would suggest. the music offers a perfect little bit of soundtracking to set the mood, and the art is not only delightful in all the self-contained ways, but offers the little bit more immersive of a perspective into the world and people of charmside—which serves the story being told, and even instigates a really clever plot twist as the chapter goes on!</p>
	
	<p>also, in a broad sense, the writing style is an absolute treat. the narration ducks and weaves between reflecting aster's internal monologue and offering distinct contrast to that monologue, and speaks in such a unique voice that it gave me the feeling that I was more being told a story by an eager, eccentric, and ineffably charismatic acquaintance than I was reading one. which, I suppose in a metanarrative way I <i>was</i> being told a story by that kind of person, but either way, it's not every story that dares to make its authorial voice so loose and intimately personal, and this one pulls it off spectacularly! this is a writer who knows the rules and is breaking them with glee.</p>
	
	<p>speaking of aster, goodness I've never felt so overjoyed to be knocking around in a particular character's noggin than in this story. immediately in the story aster establishes themselves as a fascinating creature of contrasts, daringly inquisitive in some aspects but apprehensive and repressed in others. they empathize strongly with those around them and hold a strong desire to know people and their perspectives, but the fascinating thing here is that where so many other stories would portray this as naive or obnoxious behavior, a preoccupation with the external world that belies a shallowness or superficiality of the internal self, this fascination is actually an <i>expression</i> of aster's internal self. to borrow a structure of phrase aster themselves uses in reference to selené in the opening of scene 8: their inquisitiveness is the <i>effect,</i> and their <i>personality</i> is the cause.</p>
	
	<p>aster also struggles with a very compelling sort of repression throughout the story, which is challenged by both drippy and sandalphon in various ways. it's not that aster has a problem with drippy's huge boobs or sandalphon's powerful flirtiness, but that aster is very concerned with engaging with people in the correct, proper, or otherwise not "rude" way. because of their issues with their perceived relationship between themselves and the monsters around them, they feel obligated to interact with this world as an outsider and gate themselves off from asking or doing the things that they want to do, and that they know they want to do.</p>
	<img src="/images/ckc2.avif">
	<p>of course, the monsterness is also equivalent to queerness. there's a reflex to see it as allegorical, but I think a large part of what the story spends its time saying and what aster ends up learning is that words like "monster" and "queer" are one and the same; they only have concrete meaning insofar as they can be construed as an outgroup, and to needlessly fixate on the vocabulary of the matter is to cut through the messy beauty of lived experience and create dividing lines that not only need not exist, but are active sources of pain and confusion.</p>
	
	<p>this is why I find myself drawn to mally's presence in this chapter. mally's interactions with aster are defined by mally completely trampling over not only the idea of propriety—they literally call aster "puppy" a whole bunch in conversation, for crying out loud—but also of there needing to be reasons or rhymes for things. aster is constantly in the dark as to why mally is doing things or why they're saying things, and they're content to simply assert whatever they want during a conversation while treating the motivations for doing so as self-evident. any time aster <i>does</i> realize what mally means by something, it's usually revealed to just be one of the most straightforward things it could've meant, which aster keeps missing because of how busy they are either jumping at conversational shadows or not just asking them for clarification.</p>
	
	<p>along those lines, a very powerful part of this narrative to me is that despite being somebody seemingly comfortable in their existence as a cute nonbinary weirdo and who generally reads as what we might call queer, aster still has all of these hangups. it highlights the necessity of understanding that this kind of self-discovery doesn't start and end with realizing that you're part of the societal outgroup, and that it's still very much possible to feel like you don't belong to a community that you're by all rights eagerly welcomed into. the "queer community" can feel like something of a monolith, something with conditions to entry in the form of definitions and descriptors. I myself have felt similar weird feelings interacting with "being a trans woman" as a concept, and have found myself notably happier the less I actively try to make myself into a woman and the more I just...let myself <i>be</i> a woman.</p>
	
	<p>and one of the most prominent ways that all of this manifests is through the vectors of sex and eroticism. by their nature, these are the things that strip down the walls of what should or ought to be and demands that attention be brought onto what simply, undeniably, irresistibly <i>is.</i> boobs and bulges and voluminous thighs are all candidly explored and appreciated in both the art and the prose of the story, not necessarily emphasized <i>narratively</i> but still demonstrating emphasis just by way of the fact that they're acknowledged at all when so much media would pretend those kinds of things aren't there. aster's skintight shorts show off their figure with a degree of clarity that borders on the pornographic, and isn't even necessarily <i>not</i> pornographic. it's not the most important deal ever, but like, it's still there and still encourages appreciation. the clarity and explicitness with which humanoid bodies are presented in the story mirrors the ways in which people in general can be so captivating and beautiful if we have the thoughtfulness to remind ourselves of everything that's there.</p>
	
	<p>the dynamic between sandalphon and aster is also especially illustrative here. despite the amount of flirting they get up to and the suggestive turns that flirting often takes, aster makes a surprisingly prescient remark to themselves through the narration that really goes to show the whole point I'm making here:</p>
	<blockquote>Also, as long as we're counting, Aster <i>does</i> find the dude extremely hot. Aster has a lot of types, if this overeventful night hasn't driven that home already. What <i>isn't</i> clear just yet is what that <i>means</i>: at the moment it seems to mean that the two are having a lot of fun wasting time over fries, with the rest of the night left comfortably unspecified. How cool is that?</blockquote>
	<p>there's no fussing and fretting over what it means to flirt with a cute angel boy at the diner, what that might mean for their relationship, how formal it's acceptable to be with each other for having met for the first time today, none of that. it's just two people having a good time, enjoying each other and themselves. sometimes life can just be like that! life is at its best when it's like that, I think.</p>
	
	<p>so, I don't normally do this, so understand that me doing this is a signal that I'm being really serious about it and really want this to be hammered home: please read this story and read all the bits of the story that are gonna come later and tell all your friends about it. my love for this story and valerie's stuff is personal in a way unlike a lot of other things that I love, and it's really important to me that he gets the recognition that she goddamn deserves for telling stories this good. okay? can you do that for me? I'm gonna put in all those links I usually put at the bottom of my reviews now, and I want you to click on them please. do it.</p>
