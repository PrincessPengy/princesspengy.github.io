<p>(and also, a post-mortem critique of my own so-called video essay, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-8GDthC1Zc">"Inscryption: This Is How a Game Dies"</a>.)</p>

<p>I was talking with O.D. the other day about my inscryption video, and in particular some criticisms that were issued with it by people in the comments section—which I make a point of never paying any attention to lest the cacophony of disparate strongly voiced opinions completely fry my brain. I'll talk more about what we discussed throughout this post, but one of the things we ended up talking about is this idea that there are kinda two different sorts of subjective statement that you can voice during something like a longform video: a <i>personal experience,</i> something that's inherently unfalsifiable by way of being your own lived experiences or feelings as a person, and an <i>opinion,</i> some observation of reality or other external circumstances that you come to conclusions about from your own accumulated experience and knowledge. "this video game made me feel sad" is a personal experience, and "this video game is meant to make you feel sad" is an opinion. you can only meaningfully argue with one of these two things!</p>

<p>but there's a blurriness to the way those two things are approached in the current-day space of media analysis on the internet, and in particular what's done (or, more often, isn't done) to lend them credibility and significance. and the thing is, depending on what the thing you're trying to do with your piece is, giving your opinions credibility is a crucial step of the process. the whole point of an essay is that you research your subject matter and craft your rhetoric in order to convince your audience that you know what you're talking about, and that you have something important to say!</p>

<p>the problem is, most things we call "video essays" aren't actually essays. which wouldn't be an issue, except a lot of them seem to <i>think</i> that they either are essays or have to obligate themselves to act like an essay, and I think this has created a massive optics problem.</p>

<p>as I've conceived of it, there are three major categories of thing that media anaylsis can take the form of: an opinion piece, a review, and an essay. these categories can of course be blended together if you know what you're doing, but you have to be aware that these three are all different things that serve different purposes to be able to do that.</p>

<p>the purpose of an opinion piece is to encourage discussion and provide new alternative perspectives to a topic. although having solid rhetoric helps make an opinion piece more credible, the credibility often isn't the point so much as just getting your thoughts out there and being heard in the first place. this blog post you're reading right now is an opinion piece—I'm speaking to trends I've noticed in video essays as well as my personal experiences in having made a few of them, in the hopes that it fosters thoughtfulness and consideration for finer points of the medium that I don't see people discussing.</p>

<p>a review has a pretty specific purpose, which is to elaborate on whether a piece of media is worthy of merit and attention. there's a level of rhetorical backbone that has to be established here, but provided you keep your talking points focused to your subject matter with maybe a few occasional branches outward into related pieces of media, you aren't obligated to provide a bibliography or anything.</p>

<p>then there are essays, which can have all sorts of specific purposes, but generally speaking are about using the themes and details found in your subject matter to make some broader point about a topic connected but fundamentally external to the work. that broader point is the thesis, and structurally speaking, essays are typically more about convincing the audience of the connections and importance of the thesis, rather than those of the work itself.</p>

<p>hbomberguy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsNm2YLrk30">"pathologic is genius, and here's why"</a> is the tentpole example of the longform review video, and serves as a pretty solid foundation for what a review is. although there are occasional broader pontifications on game development and the nature of art, the video isn't <i>about</i> those things in any greater capacity than the extent to which those subjects are highlighted by the game.</p>

<p>but if we look to harris's own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8u8wZ0WvxI">"outsiders: how to adapt h.p. lovecraft in the 21st century"</a>, we find something muddier. I wouldn't call it a review, because although dan gildark's cthulhu is the focal point of the video, the video isn't <i>about</i> that movie so much as it is about the broader conclusions it inspires about the themes of lovecraft's work and how that might translate to a more modern audience. and yet, despite this seemingly pointing to the video instead being an essay, I don't know that I could really tell you what the point the video is trying to make is. the series of pontifications on and examples of the various works described as being inspired by lovecraft's writing doesn't really rhetorically go anywhere besides to say that those things exist and that the existence of those things is interesting. this combined with a large part of the video being dedicated to harris's personal experiences with the movie and with the topics approached by the movie, then, would suggest that this is more of an opinion piece, right? it's unclear. it's not even a bad video, but it's kind of a mess if you really pay attention to it.</p>

<p>when it comes to my own video about inscryption, one of the biggest problems was its lack of rhetorical discipline. the genesis of the video came from the fact that I wasn't seeing anybody talking about inscryption's actual interesting story and narrative, and as I continued writing the thing, more and more opinions were grafted onto it: my observations about the stratification of independently produced video games, the habit of video makers to regurgitate "lore" or "secrets" as though doing so constitutes any kind of meaningful observation about a piece of media, and the way the hex has been grafted onto the creator's other games and stripped of any independent significance despite its own merits. it became an undisciplined slurry of everything inscryption made me feel, and even though I think I realized that after a point, by that time it was too late to course correct without burning the whole thing down and starting over.</p>

<p>and yet, despite the fact that in my heart I wanted to write an opinion piece—a collage of things this game reminded me of and made me feel in the hopes that doing so would prompt general thoughtfulness about the way we look at games like inscryption and the hex—I had gotten the idea in my head that what I was making was an <i>essay,</i> and this compelled me to go broader with the things I talked about and start making points about the games industry and the idolization of indie developers and all of that other stuff. but those two warring motivations kept butting into each other, leading to flaws like a rhetorical overreliance on opinion and a tendency to forget to elaborate on stuff I set up earlier in the video because my idea of the thesis of the video kept warping over time. all that character analysis of leshy and the scrybes that I did earlier kinda fails to go anywhere for most of the rest of the runtime!</p>

<p>and I feel like being more deliberate about what we call a "video essay" could do some real good in encouraging better practices about this kind of thing. things like hbomberguy's reviews or jacob geller's undeniably charismatic ponderings are called essays and treated as equal in this field to actual honest to god essays like dan olson's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKP1I7IocYU">"why it's rude to suck at warcraft"</a>. these things are all different! they're all trying to do different things, and I think in talking about them it behooves us to remain aware of that distinction, because that not only improves our ability to engage with them thoughtfully, it also establishes better expectations for people like me who are inspired by these longform analysis videos and end up wanting to make their own. if I had been a lot more cognizant of these differences between different kinds of analysis and different kinds of subjective statements, I probably would've made a way better video, and maybe the ways I blurred some of those categories together could've been done with more purpose and effectiveness. it's a large part of why the third video has been taking so long to make—because, before I make anything, I want to be really really sure of why I'm doing it.</p>
